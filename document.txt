emma woodhouse handsome clever and rich with a comfortable home
and happy disposition seemed to unite some of the best blessings
of existence and had lived nearly twenty one years in the world
with very little to distress or vex her

she was the youngest of the two daughters of a most affectionate
indulgent father and had in consequence of her sister's marriage
been mistress of his house from a very early period her mother
had died too long ago for her to have more than an indistinct
remembrance of her caresses and her place had been supplied
by an excellent woman as governess who had fallen little short
of a mother in affection

the wedding was very much like other weddings where the parties
have no taste for finery or parade and mrs elton from the
particulars detailed by her husband thought it all extremely shabby
and very inferior to her own very little white satin very few
lace veils a most pitiful business selina would stare when she
heard of it but in spite of these deficiencies the wishes
the hopes the confidence the predictions of the small band
of true friends who witnessed the ceremony were fully answered
in the perfect happiness of the union
